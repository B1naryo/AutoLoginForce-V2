AutoLoginForce - Automated Brute-Force Login Testing

Description: This Python code, developed by B1naryo, is a brute-force testing tool to automate login attempts on a specific URL (https://www........../admin/login.asp). It loads a list of passwords from a file and performs login attempts with each password, logging invalid URLs and displaying progress. This code utilizes the Selenium library to automate the login process across multiple browsers in parallel and can be configured to use a specified number of threads. It is a useful tool for security testing purposes and demonstrates the use of threads and automation with Selenium. Make sure to use it only for legal and authorized purposes.
